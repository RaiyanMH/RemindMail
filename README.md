# RemindMail

A simple yet powerful desktop reminder app that emails you exactly when you need it.

A desktop application built with Electron, React, and Node.js that allows you to create reminders with scheduled email notifications.

## Features

- ✨ **Reminder Creation**: Create reminders with title, description, email, and multiple scheduled times
- 📧 **Email Notifications**: Automatically sends emails at scheduled times using NodeMailer
- 💾 **Local Storage**: Persists reminders using JSON file storage
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- 🌓 **Theme Support**: Light, Dark, and Auto (system) theme modes
- ⚙️ **SMTP Configuration**: Configure your email settings in the app
- 🔄 **Auto-cleanup**: Automatically removes reminders after all scheduled emails are sent

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

For development with DevTools:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

### Email Setup (SMTP)

Before creating reminders, you need to configure your SMTP settings:

1. Click the Settings (gear) icon in the top right
2. Enter your SMTP configuration:
   - **SMTP Host**: e.g., `smtp.gmail.com` for Gmail
   - **SMTP Port**: Usually `587` for TLS or `465` for SSL
   - **Secure Connection**: Check if using SSL
   - **Email/Username**: Your email address
   - **Password**: Your email password or App Password

### Gmail Setup

For Gmail users:
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Use the App Password in the settings (not your regular password)

### Other Email Providers

Common SMTP settings:
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com`, Port: 587
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com`, Port: 587 or 465
- **Custom SMTP**: Use your provider's SMTP server details

## Usage

1. **Create a Reminder**:
   - Click the "Add Reminder" button
   - Fill in the title (required)
   - Optionally add a description (if blank, title will be used in email body)
   - Enter the recipient email address
   - Add one or more scheduled date/time combinations
   - Click "Save Reminder"

2. **View Reminders**:
   - All active reminders are displayed in cards
   - Each card shows the next scheduled time and remaining count
   - Click "Expand" to see all scheduled times for a reminder

3. **Delete a Reminder**:
   - Click the trash icon on any reminder card
   - Confirm deletion

4. **Change Theme**:
   - Open Settings
   - Select Light, Dark, or Auto theme

## How It Works

- **Scheduler**: A background process checks for due reminders every 60 seconds
- **Email Sending**: When a reminder time is reached, the app sends an email using the configured SMTP settings
- **Auto-cleanup**: After all scheduled times for a reminder have passed and emails sent, the reminder is automatically removed
- **Storage**: All reminders and settings are stored locally in JSON files in the app's user data directory

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Electron main process
- **Email**: NodeMailer for SMTP email sending
- **Storage**: JSON file-based storage
- **Scheduler**: Node.js setInterval running every 60 seconds

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

This application is currently in active development and may contain some limitations:

- **Development Status**: The application is functional but may have some edge cases and minor issues that require further testing and refinement.

- **Email Authentication**: Currently uses SMTP with basic authentication. A significant improvement would be to integrate the Gmail API, which would provide:
  - More reliable authentication without requiring app passwords
  - Better security through OAuth 2.0
  - Improved error handling and rate limiting
  - Enhanced compatibility with Gmail's security policies

- **Development Console**: When running in development mode (`npm run dev`), you may notice warnings in the browser console. These are primarily related to:
  - CDN-based dependencies (Tailwind CSS, Babel) which are used for development convenience
  - Content Security Policy configurations
  - These warnings do not affect functionality but should be addressed in production builds

- **Error Handling**: While the application handles common error scenarios, there may be edge cases that require additional error handling and user feedback mechanisms.

Contributions and improvements are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
